## Abstract
Phishing emails are fraudulent messages that attempt to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information or installing malware. Detecting phishing emails is a challenging task, as they use different techniques to mimic legitimate senders and trick users. In this project, we propose a phishing email detection application that leverages machine learning to analyze the content and metadata of emails and classify them as phishing or non-phishing. The application also provides feedback to the user on why an email is suspicious and how to avoid falling victim to phishing attacks. The application is designed to be user-friendly, scalable, and adaptable to different email platforms.
